## Client library support

MemCachier will work with any memcached binding that supports [SASL
authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Authentication_and_Security_Layer)
and the [binary
protocol](https://github.com/memcached/memcached/wiki/BinaryProtocolRevamped).
In the following you can find a list of all clients known to us including a
description of their most important features. This list is by no means exhaustive
and if you know of a client not on this list, don't hesitate to contact us. All
clients marked as supported have been tested with our service.
