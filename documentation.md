# Getting Started with MemCachier

MemCachier is an implementation of the
[Memcache](http://memcached.org) in-memory key/value store used for
caching data. Memcache a key technology in modern web applications for
scaling and reducing server loads. MemCachier manages and
scales clusters of memcache servers so you can focus on your app. Tell
us how much memory you need and get started for free instantly. Add
capacity later as you need it.

Below is our user guide for using MemCachier, you can also find answers
in our <a href="/faq">FAQ</a>.

<h2 id="ruby">Ruby</h2>

Start by adding the [dalli](https://github.com/mperham/dalli) gem to your Gemfile.

```ruby
gem 'dalli'
```

Then bundle install:

```text
$ bundle install
```

`Dalli` is a Ruby memcache client.  Once it is installed you can start writing code. The following is a basic example showing get and set.

```ruby
cache = Dalli::Client.new(<MEMCACHIER_SERVERS>.split(","),
                    {:username => <MEMCACHIER_USERNAME>,
                     :password => <MEMCACHIER_PASSWORD>
                     :failover => true,
                     :socket_timeout => 1.5,
                     :socket_failure_delay => 0.2
                    })
```

The values for `<MEMCACHIER_SERVERS>`, `<MEMCACHIER_USERNAME>`, and `<MEMCACHIER_PASSWORD>` are listed on your [cache overview page](https://www.memcachier.com/caches).

From here you can use the following code examples to use the cache in your Ruby app:

```ruby
cache.set("foo", "bar")
puts cache.get("foo")
```

You can also get an insight into your cache usage (number of keys stored and bytes) with the `stats` command:

```ruby
cache.stats
=> {"memcachier.example.net:11211" => {"cur_items" => "49982", "bytes" => "89982234"} }
```

We’ve built a small Ruby example using Sinatra here: [MemCachier Sinatra Sample App](https://github.com/memcachier/examples-sinatra).


<h2 id="rails3">Rails 3 & 4</h2>

Start by adding the [dalli](https://github.com/mperham/dalli) gem to your Gemfile.

```ruby
gem 'dalli'
```

Then bundle install:

```text
$ bundle install
```

`Dalli` is a Ruby memcache client.  Once it is installed you’ll want to configure the Rails cache_store appropriately. Modify `config/environments/production.rb` with the following:

```ruby
config.cache_store = :dalli_store, <MEMCACHIER_SERVERS>.split(","),
                    {:username => <MEMCACHIER_USERNAME>,
                     :password => <MEMCACHIER_PASSWORD>
                     :failover => true,
                     :socket_timeout => 1.5,
                     :socket_failure_delay => 0.2
                    }
```

The values for `<MEMCACHIER_SERVERS>`, `<MEMCACHIER_USERNAME>`, and `<MEMCACHIER_PASSWORD>` are listed on your [cache overview page](https://www.memcachier.com/caches).

<p class="alert alert-info">In your development environment, Rails.cache defaults to a simple in-memory store and so it doesn’t require a running memcached.</p>

From here you can use the following code examples to use the cache in your Rails app:

```ruby

puts Rails.cache.read("foo")
```

We’ve built a small Rails example here: [MemCachier Rails sample app](https://github.com/memcachier/examples-rails).


<h2 id="rails2">Rails 2</h2>

Start by adding the [dalli](https://github.com/mperham/dalli) gem to your Gemfile. You will need to use dalli **v1.0.5** as later versions of Dalli don't
support Rails 2.

```ruby
gem 'memcachier'
gem 'dalli', '~>1.0.5'
```

Then bundle install:

```text
$ bundle install
```

`Dalli` is a Ruby memcache client.  Once it is installed you’ll want to configure the Rails cache_store appropriately. Modify `config/environments/production.rb` with the following:

```ruby
require 'active_support/cache/dalli_store23'
config.cache_store = :dalli_store, <MEMCACHIER_SERVERS>.split(","),
                    {:username => <MEMCACHIER_USERNAME>,
                     :password => <MEMCACHIER_PASSWORD>
                     :failover => true,
                     :socket_timeout => 1.5,
                     :socket_failure_delay => 0.2
                    }
```

The values for `<MEMCACHIER_SERVERS>`, `<MEMCACHIER_USERNAME>`, and `<MEMCACHIER_PASSWORD>` are listed on your [cache overview page](https://www.memcachier.com/caches).

<p class="alert alert-info">In your development environment, Rails.cache defaults to a simple in-memory store and so it doesn’t require a running memcached.</p>

Also modify`config/environment.rb` to contain:

<h2 id="rack">Rails Rack::Cache</h2>

Rails can use a middle-ware component of the Rack web server architecture called Rack::Cache. This provides caching of static assets in Rails and is a simple alternative to use a full CDN.  

Please see [this
article](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/rack-cache-memcached-rails31#configure-rails-cache-store)
for information.


<h2 id="python">Python</h2>

<p class="alert alert-info">
We support the `pylibmc` memcache client as it has great performance
and recently added Python 3 support. However, it can sometimes be
difficult to install locally as it relies on the C libmemcached
library. If you prefer, you can try a pure python client,
[python-binary-memcached](https://github.com/jaysonsantos/python-binary-memcached),
which works well but only supports Python 2 right now.
</p>

Here we explain how you setup and install MemCachier with Python.

MemCachier has been tested with the `pylibmc` memcache client. This
client relies on the C libmemcached library. This should be fairly
straight-forward to install with your package manager on Linux or
Windows. We also have a
[blog post](http://blog.memcachier.com/2014/11/05/ubuntu-libmemcached-and-sasl-support/)
for Ubuntu users on how to do this. Once it's installed, then install
`pylibmc`:

```term
$ pip install pylibmc
```

Be sure to update your `requirements.txt` file with these new
requirements (note that your versions may differ than what’s below):

```text
pylibmc==1.4.0
```

<p class="alert alert-info">
<b>Heroku Users:</b> The above `pylibmc` requirements must be added
directly to your `requirements.txt` file. They shouldn't be placed in
an included pip requirement file. The Heroku Python buildpack checks
the `requirements.txt` file and only that file for the presence of
`pylibmc` to trigger bootstrapping `libmemcached`, which is
prerequisite for installing `pylibmc`.
</p>


Next, configure your settings.py file the following way:

```python
import pylibmc

servers = os.environ.get('MEMCACHIER_SERVERS', '').split(',')
user = os.environ.get('MEMCACHIER_USERNAME', '')
pass = os.environ.get('MEMCACHIER_PASSWORD', '')

mc = pylibmc.Client(servers, binary=True,
                    username=user, password=pass,
                    behaviors={"tcp_nodelay": True,
                               "ketama": True,
                               "no_block": True,})
```

After this, you can start writing cache code in your Python app:

```python
mc.set("foo", "bar")
print mc.get("foo")
```

<p class="alert alert-info">
A confusing error message you may get from `pylibmc` is <b>MemcachedError: error 37 from memcached_set: SYSTEM ERROR (Resource temporarily unavailable)</b>. This indicates that you are trying to store a value larger than 1MB. MemCachier has a hard limit of 1MB for the size of key-value pairs. To work around this, either consider sharding the data or using a different technology. The benefit of an in-memory key-value store diminishes at 1MB and higher.
</p>


<h2 id="django">Django</h2>

MemCachier has been tested with the `pylibmc` memcache client, but the
default django pylibmc client doesn’t support SASL authentication.
Recently `pylibmc` added *Python 3* support in version 1.4.0.

This client relies on the C libmemcached library. This should be
fairly straight-forward to install with your package manager on Linux
or Windows. We also have a
[blog post](http://blog.memcachier.com/2014/11/05/ubuntu-libmemcached-and-sasl-support/)
for Ubuntu users on how to do this.

Once it's installed, then install `pylibmc`:

```text
$ pip install pylibmc django-pylibmc
```

Be sure to update your `requirements.txt` file with these new
requirements (note that your versions may differ than what’s below):

```text
pylibmc==1.4.0
django-pylibmc==0.5.0
```

<p class="alert alert-info">
<b>Heroku Users:</b> The above `pylibmc` requirements must be added

`pylibmc` to trigger bootstrapping `libmemcached`, which is
prerequisite for installing `pylibmc`.
</p>

Next, configure your settings.py file the following way:

```python
os.environ['MEMCACHE_SERVERS'] = os.environ.get('MEMCACHIER_SERVERS', '').replace(',', ';')
os.environ['MEMCACHE_USERNAME'] = os.environ.get('MEMCACHIER_USERNAME', '')
os.environ['MEMCACHE_PASSWORD'] = os.environ.get('MEMCACHIER_PASSWORD', '')

CACHES = {
    'default': {
        'BACKEND': 'django_pylibmc.memcached.PyLibMCCache',
        'BINARY': True,
        'OPTIONS': {
            'no_block': True,
            'tcp_nodelay': True,
            'tcp_keepalive': True,
            'remove_failed': 4,
            'retry_timeout': 2,
            'dead_timeout': 10,
            '_poll_timeout': 2000
        }
    }
}
```

The values for `<MEMCACHIER_SERVERS>`, `<MEMCACHIER_USERNAME>`, and
`<MEMCACHIER_PASSWORD>` are listed on your [cache overview
page](https://www.memcachier.com/caches). Note that Django expects
<MEMCACHIER_SERVERS> to be semicolon-delimited (while we provide it
comma-eliminated).

Finally, we also *strongly* recommend that you place the following
code in your `wsgi.py` file to correct a serious performance bug
([#11331](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/11331)) with Django
and memcached. The fix enables persistent connections under Django,
which by default uses a new connection for each request:

```python
# Fix django closing connection to MemCachier after every request (#11331)
from django.core.cache.backends.memcached import BaseMemcachedCache
BaseMemcachedCache.close = lambda self, **kwargs: None
```

After this, you can start writing cache code in your Django app:

```python
from django.core.cache import cache
cache.set("foo", "bar")
print cache.get("foo")
```

We’ve built a small Django example here: [MemCachier Django sample app](https://github.com/memcachier/examples-django).

You may also be interested in the [django-heroku-memcacheify](http://github.com/rdegges/django-heroku-memcacheify) pip, which fully configures MemCachier with one line of code for any Django app the pip supports.

<p class="alert alert-info">

<h2 id="php">PHP</h2>

We recommended you use the [PHP Memcached client](http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.memcached.php) to connect with MemCachier. It supports the full protocol and has great performance. We also recommend that you use the [composer dependency manager](https://getcomposer.org/) for PHP, although that is up to you.

It can be difficult to get the memcached client to work as it requires that you build it against a version of libmemcached (a C library that the PHP client relies upon) that support SASL authentication, which often isn't enabled by default. If you have trouble, please open a [support ticket](http://support.memcachier.com/) with us. Alternatively, you could use a [pure PHP client](#php-memcachesasl) that MemCachier supports, instructions on how are [here](#php-memcachesasl).

First, if using composer, you'll need to modify your `composer.json` file to include the module:

```js
{
    "require": {
        "php": ">=5.3.2",
        "ext-memcached": "*"
    }
}
```

Then, you can connect to MemCachier using the client:

```php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

// create a new persistent client
$m = new Memcached("memcached_pool");
$m->setOption(Memcached::OPT_BINARY_PROTOCOL, TRUE);

// some nicer default options
$m->setOption(Memcached::OPT_NO_BLOCK, TRUE);
$m->setOption(Memcached::OPT_AUTO_EJECT_HOSTS, TRUE);
$m->setOption(Memcached::OPT_CONNECT_TIMEOUT, 2000);
$m->setOption(Memcached::OPT_POLL_TIMEOUT, 2000);
$m->setOption(Memcached::OPT_RETRY_TIMEOUT, 2);

// setup authentication
$m->setSaslAuthData( <MEMCACHIER_USERNAME>
                   , <MEMCACHIER_PASSWORD> );

// We use a consistent connection to memcached, so only add in the
// servers first time through otherwise we end up duplicating our
// connections to the server.
if (!$m->getServerList()) {
    // parse server config
    $servers = explode(",", <MEMCACHIER_SERVERS>);
    foreach ($servers as $s) {
        $parts = explode(":", $s);
        $m->addServers($parts[0], $parts[1]);
    }
}
```

The values for `<MEMCACHIER_SERVERS>`, `<MEMCACHIER_USERNAME>`, and `<MEMCACHIER_PASSWORD>` are listed on your [cache overview page](https://www.memcachier.com/caches).

You should look at the PHP [Memcached client documentation](http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.memcached.php) for a list of API calls you can make against MemCachier.

We’ve built a small PHP example here: [MemCachier PHP sample app](https://github.com/memcachier/examples-php).

<h3 id="php-session">PHP Session Support</h3>

You can configure PHP to store sessions in MemCachier as follows.

First, start by configuring an appropriate `.user.ini` in your document root. It should contain the following:

```php
session.save_handler=memcached
memcached.sess_binary=1
session.save_path="PERSISTENT=myapp_session <MEMCACHIER_SERVERS>"
memcached.sess_sasl_username=<MEMCACHIER_USERNAME>
memcached.sess_sasl_password=<MEMCACHIER_PASSWORD>
```

In your code you should then be able to run:

```php
// Enable MemCachier session support
session_start();
$_SESSION['test'] = 42;
```

<h3 id="php-memcachesasl">PHP -- MemcacheSASL</h3>

This is not our recommended client for using MemCachier from PHP. We recommend the [php memcached](#php) client. However, it is an easier client to use as it's a pure PHP implementation while the [recommended php client](#php) requires a C extension to be installed with [SASL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Authentication_and_Security_Layer) support. It doesn't support multiple proxy servers like the memcached client but is otherwise quite good.

You should first install the [PHPMemcacheSASL](https://github.com/memcachier/PHPMemcacheSASL) client. You can either grab the code directly or use [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) for package management. We suggest composer.

First, if using composer, you'll need to modify your `composer.json` file to include the module:

```js
{
    "require": {
        "php": ">=5.3.2",
        "memcachier/php-memcache-sasl": ">=1.0.1"
    }
}
```

Then, you can connect to MemCachier using the client:

```php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
use MemCachier\MemcacheSASL;

// Create client
$m = new MemcacheSASL();
$servers = explode(",", <MEMCACHIER_SERVERS>);
foreach ($servers as $s) {
    $parts = explode(":", $s);
    $m->addServer($parts[0], $parts[1]);
}

// Setup authentication
$m->setSaslAuthData( getenv("MEMCACHIER_USERNAME")
                   , getenv("MEMCACHIER_PASSWORD") );

$m->add("foo", "bar");
echo $m->get("foo");
```

The values for `<MEMCACHIER_SERVERS>`, `<MEMCACHIER_USERNAME>`, and `<MEMCACHIER_PASSWORD>` are listed on your [cache overview page](https://www.memcachier.com/caches).

We’ve built a small PHP example here: [MemCachier PHP sample app](https://github.com/memcachier/examples-php).


<h2 id="cakephp">CakePHP</h2>

The CakePHP framework has excellent support for caching and can be easily used with MemCachier as the provider. To setup CakePHP with MemCachier, you'll need to edit the file `app/Config/bootstrap.php` and add the following lines:

```php
Cache::config('default', array(
    'engine' => 'Memcached',
    'prefix' => 'mc_',
    'duration' => '+7 days',
    'servers' => explode(',', <MEMCACHIER_SERVERS>),
    'compress' => false,
    'persistent' => 'memcachier',
    'login' => <MEMCACHIER_USERNAME>,
    'password' => <MEMCACHIER_PASSWORD>,
    'serialize' => 'php'
));
```

After that, you should be able to use caching throughout your application like so:

```php
class Post extends AppModel {

    public function newest() {
        $model = $this;
        return Cache::remember('newest_posts', function() use ($model){
            return $model->find('all', array(
                'order' => 'Post.updated DESC',
                'limit' => 10
            ));
        }, 'longterm');
    }
}
```

The above will fetch the value associated with the key `newest_posts` from the cache if it exists. Otherwise, it will execute the function and SQL query, storing the result in the cache using the `newest_posts` key.

You can find much more information on how to use caching with CakePHP [here](http://book.cakephp.org/2.0/en/core-libraries/caching.html).


<h2 id="symfony2">Symfony2</h2>

The [Symfony2](http://symfony.com/) framework is a great choice with MemCachier. It supports caching and storing sessions in MemCachier.

First, start by configuring an appropriate `.user.ini` in your document root. It should contain the following:

```php
session.save_handler=memcached
memcached.sess_binary=1
session.save_path="PERSISTENT=myapp_session <MEMCACHIER_SERVERS>"
memcached.sess_sasl_username=<MEMCACHIER_USERNAME>
memcached.sess_sasl_password=<MEMCACHIER_PASSWORD>
```

<h2 id="laravel">Laravel</h2>

Laravel is a great framework although as of v5.0 the built-in Cache and Session services do not support
memcached with persistent connections, options, or SASL authentication.
The [laravel-memcached-plus](https://github.com/b3it/laravel-memcached-plus) package adds support for these features
making using Memcachier a breeze.

<h2 id="node.js">Node.js</h2>

For Node.js we recommend the use of the
[memjs](https://github.com/alevy/memjs) client library. It is written
and supported by MemCachier itself! To install, use the [node package
manager (npm)](https://npmjs.org/):

```text
npm install memjs
```

Using it is straight-forward as memjs understands the
`MEMCACHIER_SERVERS`, `MEMCACHIER_USERNAME` and `MEMCACHIER_PASSWORD`
environment variables that the MemCachier add-on setups. For example:

```javascript
var memjs = require('memjs')
var mc = memjs.Client.create()
client.get('hello', function(val) {
    alert(val)
})
```

We’ve built a small Node.js example here: [MemCachier Node.js sample app](http://github.com/memcachier/examples-node).


<h2 id="java">Java</h2>

For Java we recommend using the [SpyMemcached](https://code.google.com/p/spymemcached/) client. We also recommend using the [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) build manager for working with Java applications. If you aren't using `maven` and are instead using [Apache Ant](https://ant.apache.org/) or your own build system, then simply add the `spymemcached` jar file as a dependency of your application.

<div class="alert">Please make sure to use version <strong>2.8.9</strong> or earlier! At the moment, version 2.8.10 and later have an <a href="https://code.google.com/p/spymemcached/issues/detail?id=272">issue</a> with SASL authentication that makes them unusable with MemCachier.</div>

For `maven` however, start by configuring it to have the proper `spymemcached` repository:

```xml
<repository>
  <id>spy</id>
  <name>Spy Repository</name>
  <layout>default</layout>
  <url>http://files.couchbase.com/maven2/</url>
  <snapshots>
    <enabled>false</enabled>
  </snapshots>
</repository>
```

Then add the `spymemcached` library to your dependencies:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>spy</groupId>
  <artifactId>spymemcached</artifactId>
  <version>2.8.1</version>
  <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
```

Once your build system is configured, you can start adding caching to your Java app:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import net.spy.memcached.AddrUtil;
import net.spy.memcached.MemcachedClient;
import net.spy.memcached.ConnectionFactoryBuilder;
import net.spy.memcached.auth.PlainCallbackHandler;
import net.spy.memcached.auth.AuthDescriptor;

public class Foo {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    AuthDescriptor ad = new AuthDescriptor(new String[] { "PLAIN" },
        new PlainCallbackHandler(<MEMCACHIER_USERNAME>,
            <MEMCACHIER_PASSWORD>));

    try {
      MemcachedClient mc = new MemcachedClient(new ConnectionFactoryBuilder()
          .setProtocol(ConnectionFactoryBuilder.Protocol.BINARY)
          .setAuthDescriptor(ad).build(), AddrUtil.getAddresses(<MEMCACHIER_SERVERS>));
      mc.set("foo", "bar");
      System.out.println(mc.get("foo"));
    } catch (IOException ioe) {
      System.err.println("Couldn't create a connection to MemCachier: \nIOException "
              + ioe.getMessage());
    }
  }
}
```

The values for `<MEMCACHIER_SERVERS>`, `<MEMCACHIER_USERNAME>`, and `<MEMCACHIER_PASSWORD>` are listed on your [cache overview page](https://www.memcachier.com/caches).

You may wish to look the `spymemcached` [JavaDocs](https://dustin.github.com/java-memcached-client/apidocs/) or some more [example code](https://code.google.com/p/spymemcached/wiki/Examples) to help in using MemCachier effectively.

We’ve built a small Java example here, using Jetty: [MemCachier Java Jetty sample app](https://github.com/memcachier/examples-java).


<h2 id="clients">Client library support</h2>

MemCachier will work with any memcached binding that supports [SASL authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Authentication_and_Security_Layer) and the [binary protocol](https://code.google.com/p/memcached/wiki/MemcacheBinaryProtocol). We have tested MemCachier with the following language bindings, although the chances are good that other SASL binary protocol packages will also work.

<h2 id="sample-apps">Sample applications</h2>

We've built a number of working sample apps, too. Though keep in mind that these apps are built for Heroku, so they expect `MEMCACHIER_SERVERS`, `MEMCACHIER_USERNAME`, and `MEMCACHIER_PASSWORD` to be in the environment.

* [Sinatra Example](https://github.com/memcachier/examples-sinatra)
* [Rails Example](https://github.com/memcachier/examples-rails)
* [Django Example](https://github.com/memcachier/examples-django)

* [Java Example](https://github.com/memcachier/examples-java)


<h2 id="local">Local usage</h2>

To test against your application locally, you will need to run a local memcached process. MemCachier is only available from the datacenter you signed up for. But because MemCachier and memcached speak the same protocol, you shouldn’t have any issues testing locally. Installation depends on your platform.

<div class="alert alert-info">The below examples will install memcached without SASL authentication support. This is generally what you want as client code can still try to use SASL auth and memcached will simply ignore the requests which is the same as allowing any credentials. So your client code can run without modification locally.</div>

On Ubuntu:

```text
$ sudo apt-get install memcached
```

Or on OS X (with Homebrew):

```text
$ brew install memcached
```

Or for Windows please refer to [these instructions](http://www.heckler.com.br/blog/2013/05/10/memcached-on-windows/)

For further information and resources (such as the memcached source code) please refer to the [Memcache.org homepage](http://memcached.org)

To run memcached simply execute the following command:

```text
$ memcached -v
```


<h2 id="analytics">MemCachier analytics</h2>

Our analytics dashboard is a simple tool that gives you more insight into how you’re using memcache. Here's a screenshot of the dashboard:

<p style="text-align:center;">
<img style="width:80%;" src="/images/analytics.png" alt="Analytics dashboard">
</p>

To access your application's analytics dashboard login to your [account](https://www.memcachier.com/caches) and view one of your caches.

The analytics displayed are:

* _Limit_ -- Your current cache size and memory limit. Once usage comes
  close to this amount you will start seeing evictions.
* _Live Connections_ -- Number of connections currently open to your
  cache.
* _Total connections_ -- Number of connections ever made to your cache.
  (So always larger than live connections).
* _Items_ -- Number of items currently stored in your cache.
* _Evictions_ -- Number of items ever evicted from your cache due to
  memory pressure. Items are evicted in an LRU order.
* _New Evictions_ -- Number of evictions that have occured since the
  last time we sampled your cache.
* _Hit Rate_ -- The ratio of `get` commands that return an item (hit)
  vs. the number that return nothing (miss). This ratio is for the
  period between now and when we last sampled your cache.
* _Set Cmds_ -- Number of times you have ever performed a set command.
* _Flush Cmds_ -- Number of times you have ever performned a flush
  command.

With the basic analytics dashboard we sample your cache once per hour.
With the advance dashboard we sample it once every 30 minutes.

<h2 id="advanced-analytics">Advanced analytics</h2>

We offer higher paying customers an advance version of our analytics
dashboard. Currently, this offers two primary advantages:

* _Higher Sample Rate_ -- We sample the cache for collecting analytics
  once every thirty minutes, twice the rate of the basic analytics
  dashboard. We don't sample more often than that as a higher
  granularity hasn't proven to be useful, it leads to more noise and
  less signal.
* _More Graphs_ -- We offer two additional graphs for the advanced
  analytics dashboard.
  * _Eviction Graph_ -- Your new evictions tracked over time.
  * _Connection Graph_ -- Your new connecions tracked over time.

<h2 id="newrelic">New Relic integration</h2>

MemCachier supports integration with your New Relic dashboard if you happen to be a customer of both MemCachier and New Relic. Currently this feature is only available to caches of <strong>500MB</strong> or larger. A blog post showing the integration can be found [here](http://blog.memcachier.com/2014/03/05/memcachier-and-new-relic-together/).

To setup the integration you will need to find your New Relic license key. This can be done by going to your "Account Settings" page when logged in to New Relic by click on your New Relic username in the top right corner. Then you will find your license key in the right side information column. It should be exactly 40 characters long. Please refer to the [blog post](http://blog.memcachier.com/2014/03/05/memcachier-and-new-relic-together/) for a visual walkthrough.

Once you have your New Relic licence key, it can be entered for your cache on the analytics dashboard page. In the bottom right corner there is a button to do this.

<h2 id="upgrading">Upgrading and downgrading</h2>

Changing your plan, either by upgrading or downgrading, requires no code changes. Your cache won't be lost, either.  Upgrading and downgrading Just Works™. Also, you are only ever charged by the hour for the time that you are on a certain plan. So try experimenting with different cache sizes knowing that you will only be charged for the hours you are on a plan, not for a whole month.

Changing your plan, either by upgrading or downgrading, can be done
easily at any time through your
[account](https://www.memcachier.com/caches).

* No code changes are required.
* Your cache won't be lost or reset<strong>*</strong>.
* You are charged by the hour for plans, so try experimenting with
  different cache sizes with low cost.

<p class="alert alert-info">
<strong>*</strong> When moving between the development plan to a
production plan, you <strong>will</strong> loose your cache. This is
unavoidable due to the strong separation between the development and
production clusters.

<h2 id="1mb-limit">Key-Value size limit (1MB)</h2>

MemCachier has a maximum size that a key-value object can be of
__1MB__. This applies to both key-value pairs created through a `set`
command, or existing key-value pairs grown through the use of an
`append` or `prepend` command. In the later case, the size of the
key-value pair with the new data added to it, must still be less than
1MB.

The 1MB limit applies to the size of the key and the value together. A
key of size 512KB with a value of 712KB would be in violation of the
1MB limit.

The reason for this has partially to do with how memory is managed in
MemCachier. A limitation of the high performance design is a
restriction on how large key-value pairs can become. Another reason is
that storing values larger than 1MB doesn't normally make sense in a
high-performance key-value store. The network transfer time in these
situations becomes the limiting factor for performance. A disk cache
or even a database makes sense for this size value.

<h2 id="localhost-errors">Errors about app trying to connect to localhost</h2>

By default, most memcache client look for the environment variables,
`MEMCACHE_SERVERS`, `MEMCACHE_USERNAME` and `MEMCACHE_PASSWORD` for
their configuration. These variables are used when the initialization
code for the memcache client doesn't specifically specify these values.

If these environment variables aren't set, clients generally default
to connecting to `127.0.0.1:11211` (i.e., localhost), with no username
and password.

The MemCachier add-on sets the `MEMCACHIER_SERVERS`,
`MEMCACHIER_USERNAME` and `MEMCACHIER_PASSWORD` environment variables.
So you need to either set the equivalent `MEMCACHE_*` variables from
these, or pass these values to your client when you create a new one
in your code.

For example, pseudo-code for the first approach is:

    env[MEMCACHE_SERVERS] = env[MEMCACHIER_SERVERS]
    env[MEMCACHE_USERNAME] = env[MEMCACHIER_USERNAME]
    env[MEMCACHE_PASSWORD] = env[MEMCACHIER_PASSWORD]

While pseudo-code for the second approach is:

    memClient = new MemcacheClient(ENV['MEMCACHIER_SERVERS'],
                                   ENV['MEMCACHIER_USERNAME'],
                                   ENV['MEMCACHIER_PASSWORD'])

Please be careful that you have setup the your client in all
locations. Many frameworks, such as Rails, use memcache in multiple
ways and may require you to setup initialization properly in a few
locations. Generally the first approach is preferred as it is global
while the second approach is local to each initialization.

For example, with Ruby on Rails, you'll need to setup `cache_store`,
`Rack::Cache` and the `session_store`.
